# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction – Power BI Dashboard

## 📊 Overview

This Power BI dashboard explores **passenger satisfaction levels** in the airline industry, with the goal of identifying key service areas that influence customer experience. Using a combination of demographic segmentation, service quality metrics, and delay factors, the dashboard provides a clear view of patterns behind satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

The project demonstrates my ability to:
- Design intuitive, interactive dashboards
- Build meaningful KPIs
- Use DAX for calculated fields and conditional formatting
- Translate raw survey data into actionable insights
