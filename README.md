# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Passenger Satisfaction ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard

## üìä Overview

This Power BI dashboard explores **passenger satisfaction levels** in the airline industry, with the goal of identifying key service areas that influence customer experience. Using a combination of demographic segmentation, service quality metrics, and delay factors, the dashboard provides a clear view of patterns behind satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

The project demonstrates my ability to:
- Design intuitive, interactive dashboards
- Build meaningful KPIs
- Use DAX for calculated fields and conditional formatting
- Translate raw survey data into actionable insights

## üéØ Key Objectives

- Understand how **passenger satisfaction** is influenced by:
  - Travel class (Economy, Business)
  - Trip type (Business, Personal)
  - In-flight and on-ground service quality (seat comfort, food, online support, etc.)
  - Delays (arrival and departure)
  - Demographics (age group, gender)
  
- Build a user-friendly Power BI dashboard with clear KPIs, slicers, and visual storytelling.

## üß† Key Insights

- Business class passengers show higher satisfaction than economy class.
- Passengers on **business trips** tend to be more satisfied than personal travelers.
- **Seat comfort**, **cleanliness**, and **check-in service** are top drivers of satisfaction.
- Long arrival and departure delays correlate strongly with dissatisfaction.
- Middle-aged passengers (30‚Äì50 age group) tend to rate services more critically.
