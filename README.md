# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction – Power BI Dashboard

## 📊 Overview

This Power BI dashboard explores **passenger satisfaction levels** in the airline industry, with the goal of identifying key service areas that influence customer experience. Using a combination of demographic segmentation, service quality metrics, and delay factors, the dashboard provides a clear view of patterns behind satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

The project demonstrates my ability to:
- Design intuitive, interactive dashboards
- Build meaningful KPIs
- Use DAX for calculated fields and conditional formatting
- Translate raw survey data into actionable insights

> **Note:** The raw dataset is **not included** in this repository due to privacy. Screenshots and a demo video are provided to showcase interactivity.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Understand how **passenger satisfaction** is influenced by:
  - Travel class (Economy, Business)
  - Trip type (Business, Personal)
  - In-flight and on-ground service quality (seat comfort, food, online support, etc.)
  - Delays (arrival and departure)
  - Demographics (age group, gender)
  
- Build a user-friendly Power BI dashboard with clear KPIs, slicers, and visual storytelling.
